/**
 * Where a closed app becomes a delivered message (ADR 0008).
 *
 * ## The bug this fixes
 *
 * Receipts used to be WebSocket-only. A recipient whose phone was online but whose app was
 * CLOSED could never acknowledge anything, so the sender sat on one grey tick indefinitely — for
 * a message that HAD reached the device. `onMessageReceived` runs in exactly that situation, with
 * no Activity, no React context and no JS runtime, which is why the acknowledgement is sent from
 * here in Kotlin over `POST /notifications/ack` (authenticated by the push token; see
 * `PushAckClient`).
 *
 * ## Why the ack is synchronous
 *
 * FCM keeps the process alive for the duration of this method — roughly 20 s for a high-priority
 * data message, and every push from this backend is `android.priority: high`. Handing the ack to
 * a background executor and returning would race the process being torn down, which is the
 * failure mode that looks like "it works on my phone, sometimes". Blocking here is what keeps the
 * ack alive.
 *
 * ## Order of work
 *
 * Notify first, then acknowledge. The notification is a local, sub-millisecond operation and it
 * is what the user perceives; the ack is a network round trip. Doing them the other way round
 * would put the radio's wake-up latency in front of the user's notification for no gain.

   * token), so the token is cached for the ack path and JS is told — immediately if it is alive,
   * through the queue if it is not.
