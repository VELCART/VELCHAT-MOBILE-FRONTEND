/**
 * Posting and clearing VelChat notifications from Kotlin (ADR 0008).
 *
 * Kotlin, not JS, because the case that matters is a KILLED app: the app must show the
 * notification and it must ack delivery, and spinning up a Hermes runtime per push to draw a
 * two-line notification is exactly the 03:00 battery cost §R6 forbids on a 3 GB device (§M0.1).
 *
 * ## What the notification can and cannot say
 *
 * The push carries the message body only when the server genuinely holds readable plaintext —
 * the backend's `preview.ts` owns that rule and drops the preview the moment a message is
 * encrypted, so this file must degrade gracefully to "New message" rather than assume a body.
 *
 * NAMES are never sent. The push identifies the conversation and the sender by ID, and both are
 * resolved from the maps JS mirrors into {@link PushStore} — so a display name never leaves the
 * device, and an unknown id costs a generic title instead of a wrong one.
 *
 * ## The three actions
 *
 * Reply, Mark as read and Mute all complete WITHOUT opening the app, because a notification
 * action that just launches the app is a worse version of tapping the notification.
 * {@link PushActionReceiver} handles them.
