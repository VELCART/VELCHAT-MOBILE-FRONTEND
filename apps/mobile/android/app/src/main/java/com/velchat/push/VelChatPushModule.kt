/**
 * The JS-facing surface of the push module (ADR 0008). Its typed counterpart is
 * `src/infra/push/nativePush.ts`, authored first per §M23 — keep the two in step.
 *
 * Registered as a legacy `ReactPackage` rather than a codegen TurboModule spec, which the
 * bridgeless interop layer supports and which `react-native-contacts` already relies on in this
 * app. Migrating is mechanical and deliberately deferred (ADR 0008, follow-ups).
 *
 * **Nothing here throws into JS.** Every method resolves — with `false`, `null`, or an empty
 * array — because all of this sits on app-launch paths where a rejected promise from an optional
 * subsystem becomes an unhandled rejection, and in release a red screen the user cannot dismiss.
 * Absent Firebase config, absent Play Services and a revoked permission are all normal states
 * (see `docs/push-setup.md`), not errors.
