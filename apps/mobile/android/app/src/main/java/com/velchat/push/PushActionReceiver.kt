/**
 * The notification's Reply / Mark as read / Mute buttons (ADR 0008).
 *
 * All three complete **without opening the app**, which is the whole point — an action that just
 * launches the activity is a worse version of tapping the notification. That means every one of
 * them has to work in a process with no React context, so the work is split:
 *
 *  - anything the server can be told with the push credential alone (a read receipt) happens
 *    here, natively, over `POST /notifications/ack`;
 *  - anything that needs the user's real session (sending a reply, writing a mute to
 *    `PUT /notifications/prefs`, clearing local unread) is queued in {@link PushStore} and handed
 *    to JS — immediately if a React context is alive, via a headless task if not, and on the next
 *    launch if even that is refused.
 *
 * The queue is what makes this honest: an action never silently does nothing. The worst case is
 * that it completes later than the user expected, and the notification says so.
