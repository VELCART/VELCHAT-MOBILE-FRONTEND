/**
 * The push lifecycle as a PURE reducer — no React Native, no I/O, no timers.
 *
 * Push has more edge cases than it looks: the OS rotates tokens whenever it feels like it, the
 * user can revoke notification permission from Settings while the app sleeps, and an account
 * switch must never leave the previous user's device registered. Keeping all of that in a pure
 * function means those paths are unit-tested (`__tests__/pushState.test.ts`) instead of
 * discovered in production at 3 a.m.
 *
 * The one rule everything else derives from (§M13): `isPushAvailable` is true ONLY when the
 * backend demonstrably holds our CURRENT token and the OS will let us show something. The
 * SyncEngine drops its background socket on the strength of that boolean, so an optimistic
 * `true` does not cost battery — it costs the user their messages.
