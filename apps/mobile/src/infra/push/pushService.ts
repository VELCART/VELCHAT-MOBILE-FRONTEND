/**
 * Push orchestration (§M14) — the layer that turns "the OS gave us a token" into "the SyncEngine
 * may sleep" (§M13).
 *
 * Owns exactly three long-lived subscriptions (token refresh, inbound message, app foreground)
 * and disposes all of them in `disposePush()` (§M7). Every entry point is idempotent, because
 * they are called from a mount effect, from login, and from a token-refresh callback that can
 * all land at once.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT do:
 *  - It never re-prompts for notification permission. It asks at most ONCE per install, and only
 *    when the answer is still unknown — because the onboarding screen only ever runs before a
 *    session exists, so a user who upgraded into an install that already had one was never asked
 *    at all. That produced the worst possible failure: push registered, the push arrived, the
 *    device acknowledged delivery, and `notify()` threw a SecurityException the notification
 *    layer swallows by design. Nothing reported it anywhere. After that single ask it only
 *    observes, and `resolvePushBlocker` is the user-initiated route back.
 *  - It never calls into `domain/`. Availability is published through
 *    `subscribePushAvailability`, which `app/App.tsx` wires to `syncEngine.setPushAvailable`.
 *    A direct import would close an `infra → domain → infra` cycle through the barrels.
