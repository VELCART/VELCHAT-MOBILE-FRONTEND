/**
 * Presence REST surface (§A15 / §B8, presence-service via the gateway `/presence/*`).
 *
 *   - `getPresence(userId, viewerId?, viewerIsContact?)` → GET /presence/:userId — the owner's
 *     privacy is enforced server-side when a `viewerId` is supplied (a hidden signal collapses to
 *     `offline` / strips `lastSeen`). Response `{ status, emoji?, text?, lastSeen }`.
 *   - `subscribePresence(watcher, targets[])` → POST /presence/subscribe — fan-out targets
 *     subscribers only (§A15.2); call it for the on-screen DM peer when a chat opens.
 *
 * Pure payload parsing (+ the live-frame `normalizePresenceEvent`) lives in `presenceShape.ts`.
 *
 * TWO GAPS this surface has to cover, both verified against the running backend:
 *
 *  1. NOBODY MARKS US ONLINE. `POST /presence/online` is documented as "realtime-gw calls this on
 *     connect", but the realtime gateway never does — it wires no presence client at all, and its
 *     `ping` handler refreshes only its OWN connection registry. Since the client never announced
 *     itself either, `online:{userId}` was never populated for anyone, so every peer looked
 *     offline no matter what they were doing. The client therefore announces its own presence.
 *  2. NO LIVE PUSH. The gateway's FanoutConsumer subscribes to message/receipt/caption only —
 *     never `presence.changed` — so a presence change cannot reach a socket. The REST snapshot is
 *     the only reliable path, and a one-shot read at chat-open goes stale immediately, so callers
 *     must re-read it while the chat is on screen. `normalizePresenceEvent` stays
 *     forward-compatible for when live presence push does land.
 *
 * Server-side TTLs that dictate the cadences (presence.repository.ts): `online:{u}` expires after
 * 30s (so heartbeat faster than that), and `subscribers:{u}` after 300s (so re-subscribe).
