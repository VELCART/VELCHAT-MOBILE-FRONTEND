 * Reconcile decision (§L6): a server message is dedup'd first by `client_msg_id` (our own
 * echo/ack → UPDATE the optimistic row), then by `(conversation_id, seq)` (already have it →
 * SKIP), else it is new → INSERT. Server `seq` is the ordering + identity key (never ts).
 *
 * The one exception to "same seq → skip" is a row we hold WITHOUT a body (VC-063). The gateway's
 * fan-out payload carries `text` only when the message is server-readable, so a frame routinely
 * lands as metadata alone and inserts a bodiless row; the REST copy that follows is the same
 * (conversation, seq) and is the only source of the text there will ever be. Skipping it threw
 * away the message and left a blank bubble permanently — and a peer's message can never take the
 * `client_msg_id` branch instead, because there is no client id on the wire and the insert
 * synthesises one. It stays narrow on purpose: only a MISSING body earns a write, so an ordinary
 * duplicate is still free.
