/**
 * What a failed send means (§L6) — pure policy, NO I/O.
 *
 * The distinction that matters to a user is not "how many attempts" but WHY it failed:
 *
 *   - We could not reach the server. The message is fine. WhatsApp keeps the clock icon
 *     indefinitely here, and so do we — a two-minute tunnel must never produce a screen of red
 *     retry markers the user has to tap one by one.
 *   - The server refused THIS message (malformed, forbidden). Replaying it eight times reaches the
 *     same answer eight times, so surface the retry affordance immediately.
 *   - We are rate limited. Nothing is wrong with the message, and the correct response is to stop
 *     the entire drain for a cooldown — not to walk to the next conversation and try again, which
 *     is precisely how one 429 burst used to burn an attempt on every queued message.
