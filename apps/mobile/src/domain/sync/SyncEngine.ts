/**
 * SyncEngine (§L6/§M8) — the offline-first send/receive orchestrator. One singleton owns:
 *   - ONE RealtimeSocket (opened only when online + a session exists),
 *   - the reconnect policy (full-jitter backoff; honour close 4001; single-flight connect),
 *   - the catch-up (per-conversation `sync {cursor}` + REST `afterSeq` backfill — the
 *     no-loss backstop behind best-effort WS push),
 *   - the outbox drain worker (claim due → send → ack, or back off / surface a failure).
 *
 * The local DB is the UI's source of truth (§M0): the engine only ever MUTATES the DB; the
 * UI observes it and never waits on the network. Every timer/socket/subscription is owned
 * and disposed in `stop()` (§M7). Pure decision logic (reconcile branch, backoff schedule,
 * retry threshold) lives in `infra/db/syncLogic.ts` — this file is the wiring.
