 * expiry used to only flip the state machine, leaving the chat DB, profile mirror, phone number,
 * contact graph and receipts in place for whichever account signs in next on this device.
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDES things that differ by caller and are applied by them instead:
 *   - the best-effort server-side `/auth/logout` call — pointless here, since a session that
 *     just got authoritatively rejected has nothing left to revoke;
 *   - `clearDeviceKey()` — a forced expiry keeps the device key so a silent re-provision can
 *     still happen if the session was merely stale, not genuinely over. Only a user-initiated
 *     sign-out demands a fresh OTP;
 *   - the device id (VC-014, inside `clearSession()`) — needed alongside the device key to
 *     actually ADDRESS that silent re-provision (`/auth/challenge` + `/auth/login/device-key`
 *     both take it); `signOut()` deletes it explicitly instead.

/**
 * Ask the device key to mint a brand-new session (VC-014).

 * A forced expiry is not always a real revoke of THIS device: the backend's rotating refresh
 * token detects reuse and revokes the whole token *family* whenever a client resubmits a token
 * it already rotated out — which is structurally unavoidable after any refresh whose RESPONSE
 * was lost (a timeout, a dropped connection), since the client cannot tell "the server never
 * saw it" from "the server rotated it and the reply never arrived". The device row is entirely
 * separate from that family (confirmed against the backend: revoking a family only touches
 * `refresh_tokens`, never the device), so a device that still holds its private key can always
 * get back in immediately. Trying this the moment the session is forced out — not only on the
 * next cold start (`useAuthBootstrap`) — turns a network hiccup back into nothing instead of
 * stranding the user on the sign-in screen until they happen to relaunch the app.
