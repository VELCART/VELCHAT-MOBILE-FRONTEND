/**
 * Device-contacts picker for New Chat (§F2/§G2) — the WhatsApp model: read the phone's own
 * address book, normalize every number to E.164, and blind-match it against the VelChat
 * directory (OPRF) to split contacts into "on VelChat" (tap → DM) and "invite".
 *
 * INSTANT BY CONSTRUCTION. The screen never waits on this pipeline:
 *  - the cached snapshot is read SYNCHRONOUSLY in the state initializer, so the very first
 *    render already has rows (an effect-based read costs a guaranteed spinner frame, which on
 *    a big book is the frame the user actually sees);
 *  - every long pass over the book runs in yielding chunks, so no single JS block can drop a
 *    frame — the list stays scrollable while discovery finishes behind it;
 *  - discovery is INCREMENTAL: a per-number cache means a re-run only pays for numbers it has
 *    never resolved. On a settled book that is zero numbers and zero round-trips.
 *
 * Measured motivation (2000-contact book, 2667 unique numbers, desktop V8 — the reference
 * device is several times slower): E.164 normalization ≈ 70 ms, fingerprinting ≈ 5 ms, OPRF
 * blind ≈ 1.55 s, OPRF unblind ≈ 3.47 s. The OPRF pair is the entire problem, and it used to be
 * re-paid in full whenever a single contact changed.
 *
 * Own state machine (§M20.3): checking → needsPermission → loading → ready, plus blocked /
 * unavailable. Runs are single-flight and guarded by a monotonic sequence. No plaintext number
 * is ever sent — the OPRF pipeline blinds each one client-side.
 *
 * PRIVACY: never log a name or number — only counts.
