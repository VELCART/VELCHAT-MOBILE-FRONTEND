/**
 * The push runtime (ADR 0008) — where a notification action becomes a real change.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `features/` and not in `infra/push`
 *
 * Finishing any of these actions needs the whole stack: a reply goes through the outbox and its
 * retry policy, a mute has to reach `PUT /notifications/prefs` with a bearer token, a read has
 * to clear the local badge and advance a durable watermark. `infra/push` cannot reach `domain/`
 * without closing an `infra → domain → infra` cycle through the barrels (§M3), so it publishes
 * events and this slice acts on them.
 *
 * ## What native already did before we got here
 *
 * Native sends the **delivery receipt** itself, because that is the one thing it can authenticate
 * with the push token alone — and doing it from Kotlin is the only way a CLOSED app can produce
 * a second tick at all. Reply and Mark-as-read also send their `read` receipt natively, so the
 * sender's tick turns blue at the moment of the tap rather than at next app launch. What arrives
 * here is the remainder: the part that needs the user's session.
 *
 * Every handler is therefore written to be safe to run LATE and MORE THAN ONCE. An event can be
 * delivered minutes after the tap (the queue survives a process kill), and the receipt half may
 * already have been sent. Sends are idempotent by `clientMsgId`; reads and mutes are monotonic.
