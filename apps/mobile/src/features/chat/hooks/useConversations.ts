 *
 * The hook hands the UI PLAIN ROW VIEW-MODELS, not the DB models: WatermelonDB mutates its
 * cached model IN PLACE and re-emits the SAME object reference, so anything memoised on the
 * model (our `Row`, and FlashList's own ViewHolder `prevProps.item === nextProps.item`)
 * would never see a cleared unread badge or a new preview on the chat already at the top.
 * Snapshotting primitives per emission makes the memo correct — the same trap MessageBubble
