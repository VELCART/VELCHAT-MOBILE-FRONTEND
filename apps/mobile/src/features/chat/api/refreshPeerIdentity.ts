/**
 * Keep a DM's cached name + photo honest (§M0 rule 2: fast first, correct always).

 * The chat list renders a peer's photo from the conversation row so it appears instantly with no
 * network. The obvious risk of any such cache is staleness — the peer changes their picture and
 * everyone else keeps seeing the old one forever. So the row is revalidated in the background:
 * the UI shows what it has immediately (0 ms), and if the server disagrees the row is updated and
 * the list re-renders on its own, because the list observes the database.
 *
 * Revalidation is deliberately cheap and rare: once per TTL per conversation, only for a chat the
 * user actually opens, never during scrolling, and never blocking anything the user is waiting on.
