/**
 * Chat-list render correctness (§F2).
 *
 * 1. A memoised row must re-render when its OWN fields change. WatermelonDB mutates its
 *    cached model in place and re-emits the same object reference, and FlashList's ViewHolder
 *    memo also compares `prevProps.item === nextProps.item` — so a row keyed on the model
 *    would keep showing a stale unread badge / preview forever.
 * 2. The empty state must never render before the first DB emission (it used to flash "No
 *    chats yet" on every cold start / tab mount).
